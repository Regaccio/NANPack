    "description": "Haniwa are peculiar creatures made of living clay. Most of them thrive in their glorious kingdom, feeding off abundant clay deposits, but a few adventurous types choose life as wandering merchants, sellswords, and innkeepers. \nTheir ceramic physiology has many powerful immunities, but can easily shatter like a vase from direct impacts. They can produce a sonic-boom attack from their hollow bodies.",
