    "description": "The Snails are a new infestation in these lands. They recently came to this world on vacation, but they move so slowly, they haven't made it back home yet after decades.\nLuckily, Snails are too dumb and sluggish to escape when you throw salt on them, so they're easy to exterminate.\nEveryone knows Snails have no redeeming qualities. \"Snail\" is growing in popularity as a slur nowadays.",
