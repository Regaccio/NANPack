    "name": "Angel",
    "description": "Ancient lore describes Angels as a fearsome host of glimmering celestials, bearing countless eyes and flaming wings. But rarely are true Angels seen these days; this world's link with the heavens weakens by the day, with the few great celestials daring to remain driven mad.\nOne cohort of Angels is different, though - diminutive cherubs of the lowest order, thriving in the mortal realm. Some stay to spite their haughty kin; other are merely tempted by material existence.\nWhatever their motivations, the Angels most oft encountered are small winged creatures, bearing more resemblance to the meddlesome fairies. Typecast as a flock of hyperactive gremlins, Angels also have a reputation for swooping like seagulls and stealing sweets.",
