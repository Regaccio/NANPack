    "name": "Cactoid",
    "description": "An artificial race born as a genetic experiment by reclusive beings from the Moon. In recent years, communications with their lunar masters have been spotty due to wartime disruptions, leaving a few of the Cactoid race as isolated wanderers.\nTheir cactus DNA grants them thorns, but their plant-like tissues make good kindling. A cactoid's mutant digestive tract can process rotting flesh into gunpowder, but is less efficient at digesting food.",
