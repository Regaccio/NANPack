    "description": "A hundred years ago, the primordial forces of the netherworld declared war upon the heavens, and bound mortals into eternal slavery using cursed rings.\nYet in recent years, the link between the netherworld and the overworld has been faltering.\nA few cursed mortals, bearing great rage in their hearts, dare to rise up and defy hell itself. These Accursed Ones rebel against their infernal masters, and reap punishment in return. \nTheir Seven Curses are punishing, but if an Accursed One could survive their burdens and claim the souls of his enemies, he might forge their suffering into Artifacts that defy his cursed fate.",
